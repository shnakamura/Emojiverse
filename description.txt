Emojiverse adds chat emojis to Terraria. Create custom emojis with resource packs or use the official 'Emojiverse Essentials' pack on Steam Workshop, featuring 1.6k+ default emojis.

To create your own emoji pack, reproduce the following steps:
1. Create a workshop resource pack.
2. Separate which images you want to use as emojis.
3. Create a 'Emojis/' folder within the resource pack.
4. Drag all of your images into that folder.
5. Enable your resource pack.

Following all of these steps should grant you a custom emoji pack. Do keep in mind that the supported file formats are:
- .gif
- .png
- .jpg
- .jpe
- .jpeg

To type out an emoji, start typing as you would in Discord. To insert the selected emoji, press [TAB].
