Emojiverse is a mod that brings chat emojis to Terraria.

Emojis are loaded via resource packs, except instead of saving resources in 'Content/Images' they should be stored in 'Content/Emojis'.

* Only supports .png files as of now *

- Use the '/listemojis' command to view all emojis available.
- Use ':emojiname:' syntax to print an emoji. (Alternatively [e:emojiname])
