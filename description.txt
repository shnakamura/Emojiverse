Emojiverse adds chat emojis to Terraria. Create custom emojis with resource packs or use the official 'Emojiverse Essentials' pack on Steam Workshop, featuring 1.6k+ default emojis.

To create your own emoji pack, reproduce the following steps:
1. Create a workshop resource pack.
2. Separate which images you want to use as emojis.
3. Create a 'Emojis/' folder within the resource pack.
4. Drag all of your images in that folder.

* Only supports .png files as of now *

- Use the '/listemojis' command to view all emojis available from enabled resource packs.
- Use ':emojiname:' syntax to print an emoji. (Alternatively [e:emojiname])
